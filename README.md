# Testimonial Card - GreatFrontEnd Projects Challenge

This project, a simple Testimonial Card rendered according to the design specifications listed in the provided Figma file, came from [GreatFrontEnd project](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects/challenges/testimonial-card). The project rules allowed for choosing your own tech stack, so I used it as an opportuity to create my first TailwindsCSS project.

## Project Brief and Requirements

From the [GreatFrontEnd Project Brief Page](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects/challenges/testimonial-card):

> "In this challenge, you will develop a card featuring a user testimonial, including a profile image, name, username, and the testimonial body.
>
> Implementation Requirements
>
> Design fidelity: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
>
> - Cross-browser compatibility: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
> - [Stretch goal] Handle long strings: In reality, the person's name and testimonial can be extremely long. The UI should be able to accommodate extremely long strings by either wrapping to the next line, truncating, or both.
> - [Stretch goal] Performance optimization: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
> - [Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper alt tags for images.

### Additional Feature

Dark Mode - no design specifications were given for a Dark Mode version so I created one based on the provided Light Mode version.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- [Tailwindcss v4.1 ](https://tailwindcss.com) - I used [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli) but any of the [installation methods](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) will work
- Figma (implementing designs from Figma)
